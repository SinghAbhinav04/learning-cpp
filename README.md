# C++ Practice Repository

This repository contains my exercises in C++. Below is a summary of the various concepts, features, and implementations covered in this repository.

## Concepts Practiced

### 1. **Operator Overloading**
   - Overloaded various operators to enhance class functionality and implement intuitive object manipulation.

### 2. **Inheritance**
   - Implemented single, multiple, and multilevel inheritance to explore class relationships and reusability.

### 3. **Virtual Functions and Method Overriding**
   - Practiced dynamic polymorphism through virtual functions and overriding methods in derived classes.

### 4. **Calculator**
   - A simple C++ calculator application using object-oriented principles.

### 5. **CLI Register Page**
   - Created a command-line interface (CLI) for user registration.

### 6. **Friend Class and Friend Function**
   - Used friend classes and functions to access private and protected members of other classes.

### 7. **Call by Value, Reference, and Address**
   - Explored different function parameter passing techniques: 
     - Call by value
     - Call by reference
     - Call by address

### 8. **Abstraction**
   - Implemented abstraction using pure abstract classes and virtual keywords to define interfaces.

### 9. **Standard Template Library (STL)**
   - Practiced using the following STL containers and algorithms:
     - **Containers**: `vector`, `deque`, `priority_queue`, `set`, `map`
     - **Algorithms**: Sorting, searching, and various utility functions from `<algorithm>` library

### 10. **Generic Programming**
   - Implemented:
     - **Generic Classes** to support different data types.
     - **Generic Functions** for type-independent operations.

> Note: All code is written in a single file for each concept.
